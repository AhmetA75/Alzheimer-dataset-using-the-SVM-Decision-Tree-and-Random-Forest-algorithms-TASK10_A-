TASK-10A: Please model the AD dataset using the SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest algorithms.

●	Please apply train test split (%75-%25)
●	Then grid search (hyperparameter tuning)
●	Then classification report and confusion matrix (on the test dataset)
●	Then compare the findings from the three algorithms
